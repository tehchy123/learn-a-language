Ask for words and their english translation eg: tagalog_word then english_word OR read from csv file
    use non english break words to continue program
        "Fini"
after entering two translated words, create two immutable lists while ensuring that the two words have the same position.
ask to start practice
no exits the program
yes will print a random word from the list
ask what the translated word is
if position of answer matches that of the position of the printed word, answer will be correct
go to next question
this will be running in a loop that can be broken by answering "brk"
if position of answer does not match that of the position of the printed word, answer will be incorrect
